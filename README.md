# COSC211_StackImpl
Implementation of a standard Stack/FIFO data structure.

This project was created as a lab assignment for COSC211 Data Structures. It is intended to generate postfix expressions from input infix expressions using a FIFO data structure (a stack). 

Some code and method headers were provided by prof. John Rager, all else was written/implemented by Sean Mebust.
